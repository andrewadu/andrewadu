## About me

- Backend engineer with strong DevOps/SRE habits and a database background (PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MySQL, Redis).
- Build and operate payment & revenue collection systems, inventory and mapâ€‘aware apps (PostGIS), and highâ€‘reliability
  APIs.
- Comfortable on bareâ€‘metal/VPS as well as cloud (AWS Â· Azure Â· GCP). CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- Pragmatic, securityâ€‘minded (MFA, RBAC, audit trails) with deep care for logs, metrics and tracing (Sentry, New Relic).
- Recent wins: reduced a critical workflow from **3+ minutes â†’ ~50 seconds**; supported daily volumes of **100k+**
  transactions/log events.

## What Iâ€™m focusing on

- **Payments**: resilient ledgers, idempotency, reconciliation, AML/CFT and PCI considerations.
- **Django @ scale**: async views where useful, DBâ€‘first performance (indexes, partitions, materialized views), caching.
- **Ops**: predictable deploys, GitOpsâ€‘y workflows, leastâ€‘privilege infra, incident response playbooks.

## Tech I use dayâ€‘toâ€‘day

**Languages:** Python, SQL, Bash, Go (learning)

**Frameworks:** Django, FastAPI, Lumen (PHP), Sanic, Flask

**Data:** PostgreSQL (+ PostGIS), MSSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis

**Infra/Tools:** Linux, Nginx, Gunicorn (Unix sockets), Systemd, Docker, GitHub Actions, Poetry, New Relic, Sentry
